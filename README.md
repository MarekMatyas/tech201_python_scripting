# Python scripting

A Python script is best described as a ***Python file that contains commands in logical order.***

A Python script is a collection of commands in a file designed to be ***executed like a program.***

The idea is that it will be run or executed from the command line or from within a Python interactive shell to perform a specific task.

Often a script first contains a set of function definition and then has the ***main program*** that might call the functions.

## Difference between scripting and programming

Generally, all the scripting languages are considered programming languages.

The main difference between both is scripting languages don't require any compilation and are directly interpreted.

## Why are scripts useful ? 

Scripts in Python are useful because they allow us to **automate repetitive tasks, perform data processing and analysis and create standalone programs.** 

They also provide a way to interact with the operating system and other software,enabling you to perform complex tasks more easily and quickly than if you were to do them manually.

## How are scripts used in Python ?

Scripts are executed by running the Python interpreter and passing the script file as an argument. 

The interpreter reads the script, executes the code, and returns the result.

This can be done from the command line, from within an integrated development environment (IDE), or from another Python script.

## Why Python ? 

1. Easy to learn: Python has a simple syntax, making it easy for beginners to pick up and start writing scripts.
2. Versatile: Python can be used for a wide range of tasks, from simple data processing to complex scientific simulations and everything between.
3. Large community: Python has a large and active user community that has created many libraries and tools that can be easily integrated into scripts.
4. Cross-platform: Python can be run on multiple OS's, including Windows, MacOS and Linux so scripts can be written once and run on multiple platforms.
5. Interoperability: Python can interact with other software and systems, such as databases, web services and API's, making it possible to automate complex workflows.
